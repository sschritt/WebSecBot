## Factors

CWEs Mapped | Max Incidence Rate | Avg Incidence Rate | Avg Weighted Exploit | Avg Weighted Impact | Max Coverage | Avg Coverage | Total Occurrences | Total CVEs  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
40 | 24.19% | 3.00% | 6.46 | 6.78 | 77.25% | 42.51% | 262,407 | 2,691  
  
## Overview

A new category for 2021 focuses on risks related to design and architectural
flaws, with a call for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns,
and reference architectures. As a community we need to move beyond "shift-
left" in the coding space to pre-code activities that are critical for the
principles of Secure by Design. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)
include _CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive
Information_ , _CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials_ , _CWE-501: Trust
Boundary Violation_ , and _CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials_.

## Description

Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses,
expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.” Insecure design is not
the source for all other Top 10 risk categories. There is a difference between
insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design
flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes
and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading
to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed
by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were
never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that
contribute to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent
in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure to determine
what level of security design is required.

### Requirements and Resource Management

Collect and negotiate the business requirements for an application with the
business, including the protection requirements concerning confidentiality,
integrity, availability, and authenticity of all data assets and the expected
business logic. Take into account how exposed your application will be and if
you need segregation of tenants (additionally to access control). Compile the
technical requirements, including functional and non-functional security
requirements. Plan and negotiate the budget covering all design, build,
testing, and operation, including security activities.

### Secure Design

Secure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates threats
and ensures that code is robustly designed and tested to prevent known attack
methods. Threat modeling should be integrated into refinement sessions (or
similar activities); look for changes in data flows and access control or
other security controls. In the user story development determine the correct
flow and failure states, ensure they are well understood and agreed upon by
responsible and impacted parties. Analyze assumptions and conditions for
expected and failure flows, ensure they are still accurate and desirable.
Determine how to validate the assumptions and enforce conditions needed for
proper behaviors. Ensure the results are documented in the user story. Learn
from mistakes and offer positive incentives to promote improvements. Secure
design is neither an add-on nor a tool that you can add to software.

### Secure Development Lifecycle

Secure software requires a secure development lifecycle, some form of secure
design pattern, paved road methodology, secured component library, tooling,
and threat modeling. Reach out for your security specialists at the beginning
of a software project throughout the whole project and maintenance of your
software. Consider leveraging the [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model
(SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org) to help structure your secure software
development efforts.

## How to Prevent

  * Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec professionals to help evaluate and design security and privacy-related controls

  * Establish and use a library of secure design patterns or paved road ready to use components

  * Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows

  * Integrate security language and controls into user stories

  * Integrate plausibility checks at each tier of your application (from frontend to backend)

  * Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows are resistant to the threat model. Compile use-cases _and_ misuse-cases for each tier of your application.

  * Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers depending on the exposure and protection needs

  * Segregate tenants robustly by design throughout all tiers

  * Limit resource consumption by user or service

## Example Attack Scenarios

**Scenario #1:** A credential recovery workflow might include “questions and
answers,” which is prohibited by NIST 800-63b, the OWASP ASVS, and the OWASP
Top 10. Questions and answers cannot be trusted as evidence of identity as
more than one person can know the answers, which is why they are prohibited.
Such code should be removed and replaced with a more secure design.

**Scenario #2:** A cinema chain allows group booking discounts and has a
maximum of fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. Attackers could
threat model this flow and test if they could book six hundred seats and all
cinemas at once in a few requests, causing a massive loss of income.

**Scenario #3:** A retail chain’s e-commerce website does not have protection
against bots run by scalpers buying high-end video cards to resell auction
websites. This creates terrible publicity for the video card makers and retail
chain owners and enduring bad blood with enthusiasts who cannot obtain these
cards at any price. Careful anti-bot design and domain logic rules, such as
purchases made within a few seconds of availability, might identify
inauthentic purchases and rejected such transactions.
