## Overview

A new category for 2021 focuses on making assumptions related to software
updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One
of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data. Notable Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs) include _CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from
Untrusted Control Sphere_ , _CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity
Check_ , and _CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data_.

## Description

Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that
does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an
application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources,
repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline
can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system
compromise. Lastly, many applications now include auto-update functionality,
where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and
applied to the previously trusted application. Attackers could potentially
upload their own updates to be distributed and run on all installations.
Another example is where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a
structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure
deserialization.

## How to Prevent

  * Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software or data is from the expected source and has not been altered.

  * Ensure libraries and dependencies, such as npm or Maven, are consuming trusted repositories. If you have a higher risk profile, consider hosting an internal known-good repository that's vetted.

  * Ensure that a software supply chain security tool, such as OWASP Dependency Check or OWASP CycloneDX, is used to verify that components do not contain known vulnerabilities

  * Ensure that there is a review process for code and configuration changes to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration could be introduced into your software pipeline.

  * Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation, configuration, and access control to ensure the integrity of the code flowing through the build and deploy processes.

  * Ensure that unsigned or unencrypted serialized data is not sent to untrusted clients without some form of integrity check or digital signature to detect tampering or replay of the serialized data

## Example Attack Scenarios

**Scenario #1 Update without signing:** Many home routers, set-top boxes,
device firmware, and others do not verify updates via signed firmware.
Unsigned firmware is a growing target for attackers and is expected to only
get worse. This is a major concern as many times there is no mechanism to
remediate other than to fix in a future version and wait for previous versions
to age out.

**Scenario #2 SolarWinds malicious update** : Nation-states have been known to
attack update mechanisms, with a recent notable attack being the SolarWinds
Orion attack. The company that develops the software had secure build and
update integrity processes. Still, these were able to be subverted, and for
several months, the firm distributed a highly targeted malicious update to
more than 18,000 organizations, of which around 100 or so were affected. This
is one of the most far-reaching and most significant breaches of this nature
in history.

**Scenario #3 Insecure Deserialization:** A React application calls a set of
Spring Boot microservices. Being functional programmers, they tried to ensure
that their code is immutable. The solution they came up with is serializing
the user state and passing it back and forth with each request. An attacker
notices the "rO0" Java object signature (in base64) and uses the Java Serial
Killer tool to gain remote code execution on the application server.
